# Bot

## About
Bot is a discourse bot that responds automatically to pings. It automates access to the discourse and was taken inspiration from discobot, a bot native to discourse. It is made in python selenium, using chromedriver. <br>
There is a bot currently being hosted on replit for the X-Camp Discourse.
<br><br>
*Note: Bot has only been tested on the X-Camp Discourse. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that it will work in other discourses.*
## Current Features
### Access:
The bot has the ability to post in topics and chat in DMs or chats. It also can post in PMs as long as you invite the bot into the PM. <br>
Bot can also only reply to topics in categories that the bot is in. It cannot reply in private categories that the bot doesn't have access to, for example.
### Commands:
`@bot display help`: Makes the bot output the various commands it can do and a short explanation of them.
<br><br>
`@bot ai [PROMPT HERE]`: This will generate an AI response based on the prompt. Currently, I am using Gemini-2.0-Flash Experimental. 
<br><br>
`@bot say [SOMETHING]`: The bot will parrot whatever text is after the word `say`.
<br><br>
`@bot xkcd`: This command will generate a random XKCD comic that is not a blacklisted one.
<br><br>
`@bot xkcd last` and `@bot xkcd latest`: Outputs the most recent [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) comic. 
<br><br>
`@bot xkcd blacklist`: Outputs the current list of blacklisted XKCD comics. If it's in a topic, it will additionally output the reasons a XKCD may be blacklisted.
### Other
**NO COMMAND:** If no recognizable command is detected, then the bot will output one of the following at random:
* Hi!
* Hello!
* I want to take over the world!
* How dare you ping me
<br>
**XKCD BLACKLIST:** There is a XKCD blacklist in place to block NSFW XKCD content. This blacklist is still growing, meaning you may still see a NSFW XKCD.
<br>
**FAIL SAFE:** Thanks to [ethandacat](https://github.com/ethandacat) for this idea in the first place; This feature basically allows the code to run itself again if it runs into an error. 

## Anticipated Features:
The following features may or may not come out in the future. Stay tuned!
* A command which the bot will give you the exact comic if you give it an ID. (thanks [ethandacat](https://github.com/ethandacat) for this idea)
* A command which the bot will give you the overview of a comic (all the information) given the ID.
* A command which the bot will give you all the information of an account on the forum given the username.
* More documentation (here)
